# dtu-advanced-business-analytics-project

## Introduction
Final project for DTU course Advanced Business Analytics. We worked in groups of four to provide business insights to E-commerce platform Olist by using the [publicly available dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) Each group member had their own research questions, and mine was related to seller analysis and segmentation. The aim was to use some of the methods presented during the course, so I tried to use survival analysis on the dataset.

## Seller analysis and segmentation
The goal of this notebook to examine the leads and sellers at Olist and segment them so that in the future, sales representatives can focus on the right leads. The segmentation of the sellers could also improve Olist's understanding of their customers (i.e. sellers) and give new possibilities in defining subscription packages for the different sellers.

In addition to clustering we will model the seller's time between the date they signed up at Olist and their first sale with survival analysis. In the future Olist could use the survival function predictions in improving the estimates on when the seller will start creating revenue and for example anticipate growing need for logistic partners.
